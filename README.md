## Overview

This project aims develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of individuals receiving their seasonal flu vaccines based on their demographic information, health status, and opinions on health risks and vaccine effectiveness. The model aims to identify key predictors of vaccine uptake to inform targeted public health interventions and improve vaccination rates.

## Business Understanding

According to the World Health Organization, seasonal influenza (the flu) is an acute respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses, which circulate globally. It presents a significant year-round disease burden, causing illnesses that range in severity, sometimes leading to hospitalization and death. Annually, there are around a billion cases of seasonal influenza, including 3–5 million cases of severe illness, resulting in 290,000 to 650,000 respiratory deaths.

Hospitalization and death due to influenza predominantly occur among high-risk groups. In industrialized countries, most influenza-associated deaths occur in individuals aged 65 years or older. In children under 5 years of age, 99% of influenza-related lower respiratory tract infection deaths occur in developing countries.

Most people recover from fever and other symptoms within a week without medical attention. However, influenza can cause severe illness or death, especially among high-risk groups, including the very young, the elderly, pregnant women, health workers, and individuals with serious medical conditions. Influenza spreads easily through respiratory droplets when people cough or sneeze. Vaccination is the best way to prevent the disease.

In temperate climates, seasonal epidemics occur mainly during winter, while in tropical regions, influenza can occur year-round, causing irregular outbreaks. There are four types of influenza viruses: A, B, C, and D, with types A and B causing seasonal epidemics.

**Symptoms**  Influenza is characterized by sudden onset of fever, dry cough, headache, muscle and joint pain, severe malaise, sore throat, and runny nose. Symptoms typically begin 1–4 days after infection and last around a week.

Treatment: Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms. High-risk patients should seek medical attention and may require antiviral drugs.

Epidemiology: All age groups can be affected, but those at greater risk include pregnant women, children under 5, older adults, individuals with chronic medical conditions, and those with immunosuppressive conditions or treatments. Health and care workers are also at high risk.

Prevention: Vaccination is the most effective preventive measure. Safe and effective vaccines have been used for over 60 years. Annual vaccination is recommended, especially for high-risk groups and their carers. Other preventive measures include hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, and avoiding close contact with sick individuals.
